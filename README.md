<h2>Description:</h2>
<p>This project is a UI that is set up to interact with The IMDB API. It displays the first 20 movies under the categories now playing, popular and top rated. It also lets you search by title for specific movies within those three categories. While I built this project with React, I chose not to use Redux as my state was not that large and did not need to be shared between that many components. I also decided not to use the React Context API because I never needed to pass a prop down more than two levels. Much of the logic is handled by react-router which allowed me to base style changes and what is rendered off of pathnames.</p>
